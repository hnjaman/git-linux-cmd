## Linux Terminal Commands
Here I'm considering Ubuntu distro from Linux.

### Basic Computer Operation

##### Linux user operation
Show all local user of your machine
```
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```
Add new user
```
sudo adduser username
# or
sudo useradd username
```
Add new user without password
```
adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" username
```
User password change
```
sudo passwd username
```

Grant root access to an user
```
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```
Log in to other user
```
su username
```
Log out
```
exit
```

##### File permission

4 => stands for "read"; shortly r

2 => stands for "write"; shortly w

1 => stands for "execute"; shortly x

0 => stands for "no permission."

##### User class symbol
u => user

g => group

o => Other (anyone else)

example
```
chmod 754 install_file.sh
```
here,

user will get read(4), write(2) and execute(1) permission; 4+2+1=7

group will get read(4) and execute(1) permission; 4+1=5

other will get only read(4) permission


check files permission
```
ls -l
```
Read only permission 
```
chmod 4 filename
```
All permission (4+2+1=7)
```
chmod 7 filename
```
change ownership for directory and file to other user
```
sudo chown -R  hnj directory
sudo chown -R  hnj file.txt
```
Create a directory
```
mkdir DirectoryName
```
Rename directory
```
mv oldname newname
```
Move to the directory
```
cd DirectoryName
```
Move to hierarchical directory
```
cd DirectoryName/insideDirectoryName
```
Remove empty directory
```
rm -d DirectoryName
```
Remove non-empty directory
```
rm -r DirectoryName
```
Create new file
```
touch filename.txt 	# using touch

gedit filename.txt	# using gedit

cat > filename.txt	# using cat
```
Rename file  
```
mv old.txt new.txt
```
Remove file
```
rm filename.txt
```
Remove multiple file
```
rm file1.txt file2.txt
```
File open with gedit editor
```
gedit file.txt
```
File open with nano terminal editor
```
nano file.txt
```
Check terminal command history 
```

```
Save history in a text file

```
search in history with a specific text
below will show all the command from history with java
